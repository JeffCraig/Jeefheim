**After update 0.1468 and 0.146.11, the Data Rate mods that have been improving server lag and desync problems no longer work.**

**Server Data Send Rate has been increased to 128kb/s, but this is still not enough to handle large buildings when multiple players are in the vacinity.**

**Hopefull a fix has ben found and we are able to increase that Send Rate again. Until then, avoid large builds and large groups of players.**


# Jeefheim Mod Pack
This is a collection of Quality of Life improvement mods for Valheim and Valheim servers. The collection of mods included avoid any major changes to core aspects of the game, and only include things that make gameplay a smoother experience.

This section will cover the primary changes that this mod pack includes. You can find a detailed list of all the mods, and links to their sites, in the Guilded server.

## How to install the Mod Pack
These mod files need to be applied to both the Server and Client Valheim installations. That means all players on your server should download and install them. There will be some minor issues (day/night cycle differences, etc) if they do not.

Installing is easy. Download the zip files and extract them into your Valheim installation directory.
For Steam, this is usually **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim**
Replace any existing files with those in the Mod Pack zip file.
