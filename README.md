# Jeefheim Mod Pack
This is a collection of Quality of Life improvement mods for Valheim and Valheim servers. The collection of mods included avoid any major changes to core aspects of the game, and only include things that make gameplay a smoother experience.

## Mod Improvements
This section will cover the primary changes that this mod pack includes. You can find a detailed list of all the mods, and links to their sites, in the Guilded server. 

- Server Improvements
  - The amount of data that Valheim can transmit by default is very low. Once you reace 5+ players, you might experience a high level of desync and lag. This mod increases those limits to 500kbps per player and allows servers to send/recieve at 2.5mbps

  - Better formatting for status effects

- Delete item hotkey
  - Click the Delete key while dragging an item or stack of items to permanently remove it from the server.

  - Only 50% of players are required to sleep in order to advance to the next day.
  - Days last twice as long

- Torch and Fire Improvement
  - Burnable items no longer consume resources and don't require upkeep.

- Workbench and Repair Improvements
  - Workbench build radius are increased by a lot. Only one bench per town/outpost should be necessary.
  - Station upgrades can be placed further away from their respective benches.
  - Accessing a workbench will automatically repair all of your items.

  - Repair with the hammer will now repair nearby structures as well.

## How to install the Mod Pack
These mod files need to be applied to both the Server and Client Valheim installations. That means all players on your server should download and install them. There will be some minor issues (day/night cycle differences, etc) if they do not.

**Player Installation:**
[Click here to download the Client Mod Pack](https://github.com/JeffCraig/Jeefheim/raw/main/Jeefheim%20Mod%20Pack%20-%200.145.6.zip)

Installing is easy. Download the zip files and extract them into your Valheim installation directory.
For Steam, this is usually **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim**
Replace any existing files with those in the Mod Pack zip file.
